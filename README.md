üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection Dashboard

Detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time with explainability!

This Streamlit app allows you to upload transaction data, get fraud predictions, and explore insights with SHAP feature importance. The dashboard is designed like a banking monitoring system with metrics cards, high-risk alerts, and interactive visualizations.

For GitHub, we provide a sample CSV for testing the app:

File: creditcard_sample.csv (~10,000 rows, <25MB)

Columns: Time, V1‚ÄìV28, Amount, Class (optional)

If you want, I can also add visuals and icons for each section to make it look more like a professional banking dashboard guide.
